                    <p>I was born in Bellevue, Washington, but I lived in Samamish, Washington until I was 2. I have a great mom and dad and older sister. After that, we moved to 
                      Bangalore, India. After a year and a half, we moved back to Washington. A year later, we moved to Fremont, California where I've lived here ever since.

                      I'm a rising sophomore at Mission San Jose High School. For 7-8th grade, I went the Hopkins Junior High School, and for K-6th grades, I went to Mission Valley Elementary School.

                      When I was in fifth grade, I started to learn the programming language Java. After that, I went on to learn C++, Python, and JavaScript over the next few years. In 6th grade, I got a microcontroller called an Arduino for my birthday. After this, I also developed a love for hardware. I was first introduced to the field of web development when I had and internet of things project for my Arduino. And that's one of the reasons I decided to take this class
                      . After this, I plan to move on to building an app with Java, Swift, and a Go backend.
