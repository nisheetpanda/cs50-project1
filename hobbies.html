                    <p>
                        Over the many years, I have passed time through a variety of activities.
                        Ever since I was little, I've loved LEGOs. While I got less time to play with them as I got older, I eventually discovered a tool called LEGO Digital Designer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A couple years later, I watched a video on how the LEGO movie was made. In addition to 
                      LDD, they used a program called Maya. Because Maya was expensive, I didn't try using it. I started to take Khan Academy's Pixar in the Box courses, and one day
                      a lecturer mentioned the program Blender, which I installed and started to learn.
                      After a while, I started to learn Blender and make short movies like the Lego movie.      
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another one of my favorite things to do is code.
                        My favorite things to code are algorithmic problems. My favorite language
                        is C++, due to it's power and speed. I tend to use Visual Studio Code and Vim for coding.
                        Another computer science contest I really enjoy are CTFs. I have tried a couple different 
                        categories in it, and my favorite is forensics.

                  <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                      <p>Another thing I do to destress is play videogames. I primarily play 
                          open world and action adventure games. My two favorite games are A Link to the Past and Minecraft, the former for it's entertaining story and gameplay, and the latter for 
                          its freedom.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          I also enjoy watching TV shows and movies. My favorite TV shows are 
                          mystery but I also like comedy. My favotite movies are usually scifi or animated. My favorite movie is The Social Network.
                          I also read books, and my favorite genres are fantasy, scii, nonfiction, and realsitic fiction.

                      <p>
                            I also really enjoy sports analytics. I first started exploring the subject last year, when I was trying to vote on what players
                            should be on the MLB all star team.s
